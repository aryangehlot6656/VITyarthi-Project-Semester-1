Eco-Route Emission Tracker

1. Problem Statement
With growing concerns about climate change and rising fuel costs, individuals often want to choose travel routes that are not only faster but also more environmentally friendly. However, most navigation tools prioritize time or distance alone and do not clearly show users how different travel routes impact carbon emissions.
There is a need for a simple tool that helps users compare multiple routes based on distance, traffic levels, and vehicle type to determine which route is the most eco-friendly.

 2. Scope of the Project
The Eco-Route Emission Tracker focuses on:
a)	Taking user input for three different travel routes.
b)	Considering vehicle type, distance, and traffic intensity.
c)	Applying an emission formula to estimate the carbon footprint.
d)	Displaying a comparison summary for all three routes.
e)	Suggesting the route with the lowest estimated emissions.
f)	Handling edge cases such as equal emissions using intelligent tie-breaker logic.
This project does not include real-time GPS data, live traffic updates, or actual fuel consumption measurements. Instead, it provides a simplified model suitable for academic and beginner-level programming use.

 3. Target Users
The primary users of this project include:
a)	Students learning Python and real-world problem solving.
b)	Environmentally conscious commuters.
c)	Beginner programmers looking for a practical application project.
d)	Educators who want examples of structured problem solving.
e)	Anyone interested in understanding how traffic and fuel type affect emissions.



 4. High-Level Features

a)	Vehicle type selection (CNG, Petrol, Diesel).
b)	 Traffic multipliers to simulate real world fuel impact.
c)	 Distance-based emission calculation.
d)	Three route comparison system.
e)	Tabular summary of route emissions.
f)	Automatic recommendation of eco-friendly route.
g)	Tie breaker logic for identical emission outputs.
h)	User friendly prompts and error handling.
